## Project Aim

To use SQL to analyze a music store dataset and answer questions about the store's business growth.

## Skills Learned

Learned how to use SQL to write basic SELECT statements, sort and order results, group data with GROUP BY, join tables using INNER JOIN, use subqueries and CTEs (Common Table Expressions), work with aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG), utilize the DISTINCT keyword, perform string concatenation with the || operator, filter results using the WHERE clause, and limit the number of results using the LIMIT clause.
